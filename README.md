# Project Proposal

## Project title

IvyScanner: scan and translate your documents.

### What?

I would like to build an Android application that will allow users to take a picture of a document, edit and save the image as pdf i.e. scan a document and potentially extract the text and/or translate it.

### Why?

With the transition of schools and jobs to the remote mode, not all students/professionals have consistent access to scanners available at work/study space. Thus, those who have to submit handwritten homework/illustration/report prefer taking a picture of their work on phone and converting it into pdf to submit it. However, pictures taken on the phone have unpredictable (often lower) quality than the scanned documents: pictures can be skewed (slanted to one direction), corners misplaced, lighting can be too dark/light and create shadows, which might result in non-readable images. Moreover, converting an image to pdf also requires using external conversion services, which usually require payment after a certain number of trials.
IvyScanner app solves this problem as it allows to (i) better control the quality of the resulting picture by fixing corners, adjusting lightness etc. while taking a picture and (ii) immediately save the picture as pdf on your phone. IvyScanner also provides additional text recognition and translation features: it allows to retrieve the textual content of the image using OCR and also translate the text if necessary. These additional features can become handy while working with foreign texts, during traveling or at school/work.

### For whom?

End-users are students and professionals who have a need to submit handwritten work (fill-in report, homework) electronically (usually in a pdf format). Also, the end-users include people who want to extract text from an image and/or translate the text (usually travelers, people living in a foreign language environment).

### How?

A user will take a picture of the document and save it as a pdf to his or her phone. While taking a picture, the user can adjust lighting/exposure/contrast, drag dots to corners of the text to adjust any potential skewness; then, the user can press a button to (i) extract text from an image (ii) translate the text and (iii) save the image as pdf.

### Scope

The project can be built in several stages: 1)building image preprocessor (adjust lighting/skew/exposure); 2) build feature to save the file; 3) build text recognition feature (OCR); 4) build text translator; 5) building a website to promote the app. These steps might require efforts in researching appropriate tools (APIs etc.), programming and documentation and can be divided among a group of 4-6 programmers. The project can be modified to suit the interests of other members.
