# Project Proposal

## Project title

IvyScanner: scan and translate your documents.

### What?

IvyScanner is an Android application that will allow users to take a picture of a document, edit the image, save it as a pdf file on their phone and additionally read text on the image and translate it.

### Why?

With the transition of schools and jobs to the remote mode, not all students/professionals have access to scanners available at their college/work stations. Thus, those who have to submit handwritten homework/illustration/report prefer taking a picture of their work on phone and converting it into pdf to submit it. However, pictures taken on the phone have unpredictable (often lower) quality than scanned documents: pictures can be skewed (slanted to one direction), their corners misplaced, lighting can be too dark/bright etc., which might result in non-readable images. Moreover, converting an image to pdf also requires using external conversion services, which usually require payment after a certain number of trials.
IvyScanner app solves these problems as it allows to (i) better control the quality of the resulting picture by fixing corners, adjusting lightness etc. while taking a picture and (ii) immediately save the picture as pdf on a user's phone without need for additional conversion. In contrast to its competitors, IvyScanner also provides additional text recognition and translation features: it allows to retrieve the textual content of the image using OCR, translate the text if necessary and save the output on the phone. These additional features can become handy while traveling or working with foreign texts at school/work.

### For whom?

End-users are students and professionals who have a need to submit handwritten work (fill-in report, homework) electronically in a pdf format. Also, the end-users include people who want to extract text from an image and translate it (usually travelers, students/professionals working with foreign language documents).

### How?

A user will take a picture of the document and save it as a pdf file to his or her phone. While taking a picture, the user can adjust lighting/exposure/contrast, drag dots to corners of the text to adjust any potential skewness, crop the text; then, the user can press a button to (i) save the edited image as a pdf file (ii) extract text and save the text as a pdf file(iii) extract text, translate it and save the result as a pdf file.

### Scope

The project can be built in several stages: 1)building image preprocessor (adjust lighting/skew/exposure); 2) build feature to save the file; 3) build text recognition features (OCR); 4) build text translator; 5) building a website to promote the app; 6) build any additional database features (store translated text in a database etc.). Due to the number of main steps/stages, their complexity and relative novelty of the app (e.g. there are translator apps but they don't preprocess & save the image and vice versa), building IvyScanner app might require semester long work on researching appropriate tools (APIs etc.), programming and documentation. These tasks can be divided among a group of 4-6 programmers based on skills and interest (relevant skills might include mobile development, image processing, nlp, web development, database management). The project can be modified to suit the interests of other members.
